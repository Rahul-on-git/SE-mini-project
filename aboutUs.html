             We are the students of <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in/">Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology</a>
             and this Mini Project is a bonafide work of Priotosh Mondal, Rahul Motwani, Malhar Kajale, Utsav Gavli submitted to the University of Mumbai
             in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of the degree of “Bachelor of Engineering” in “Computer Engineering” . 
             <br> <br>

             The purpose of our project is to help Educators and learners by creating a website which provides
             an interactive experience by presenting visual Demonstration of polynomial arithmetic operations 
             (Addition ,Subtraction ,Multiplication) using graphical and pictorial represention by taking inputs
             from the user and generating a pdf report of the solution including a step by step description of
             the operations and formulas used.
